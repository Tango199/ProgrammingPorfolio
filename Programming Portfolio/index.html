                <span>
                <p>
                    My name is Ryan Schlernitzauer and I am a senior at Slippery Rock University.  I am graduating in May 2015 with a Computer Science Degree.  Right now,  I am looking for
                    a software Development Position to start as close to graduation as possible.
                </p>
                
              
                <p>As of now,  I am trying to learn as much as possible.  This ranges from things like working with different programming languages, to even making this Portfolio in my free time to show
            off some of my completed work.  One of the ways that I am using to gain knowledge is watching different tutorials on Pluralsight.com. This is an effort to gain as much knowledge before
            I graduate.
                </p>
                <p>
                Right now,  I am working on three different projects.  Both of these projects will be used here at Slippery Rock University after I graudate. The first, is a group project in our Software
            Engineering class.  The main purpose of this class is to learn the Software Development Lifecycle and go through all of the steps required with a semester long project.  The semester long
            project that we chose was a project that was aimed at the Education Department here at Slippery Rock University.  When this project is finished it is going to be able to place the students into
            their off campus placements.  This is an important task because as of now,  it is all done though the "pencil and paper method" and takes a long time to get the placements to the students.
            The second project that I am working on is a project that a teacher came to me and asked if I would like to work on it.  This project is a Java Web application for the University to keep track of
            the chemicals that are on campus.  This project is teaching me alot about Java Web development. The third project is a small project that you have already seen (or began to see), my web portfolio.
            This website has increased my knowledge in web programming in areas such as JQuery, CSS, and using Bootstrap.  Within the portfolio tab, I will give more technical details about my projects as well as some
            visuals of a few.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                    If you have any questions or even if you would just like to say hello, feel free to contact me.

              <h3 id = "educationPlacementDetailsTitle"><u>Education Placement Project (current project)</u></h3>
                <span id="educationProjectDetails">
                    <p> This project is a project that is directed towards the Special Education Department here at Slippery Rock University and being completed in my Software Engineering class (capstone class).
                    The main idea of this project is to learn the Software Development lifecycle and to experience each step. The project is being completed in a group of 4, and we are looking to leave this 
                    project working with the Special Education Department when we leave.
                    </p>
                    <p>This software product is going to be used to place students in their out of class placements (within the districts around the Slippery Rock area).  We thought of this project
                    because the way that they do it now is all by hand.  The first thing that the placement director has to do is send a piece of paper to each student and have the place there regions
                    in order from 1 to 6 on where they would like to be placed.  After that is filled out they give it back to the placement director and then it is his job to choose the placements.
                    He puts students in 6 piles based on their choosings and after the schools reply with how many students they would like, the placement director goes through and handpicks the placements.
                    We thought that this would be a much easier process to modify in the following ways
                    </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create an administrator windows application used to input the students and schools into a MySQL database</li>
                            <li>Create a web interface used by the students to select their preferences remotely(no paper required)</li>
                            <li>After a certain date, the placement director presses a button on the administrator window and the placements are generated</li>
                    
                        </ol>
                    <p>Here is a list of some of the technical details of our project (please keep in mind that this is a ongoing project, so any of these details can change periodically)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The administrator Windows application is created within c# </li>
                            <li>There will be multiple ways for a administrator to input infomation</li>

                            <li>The web application will combine HTML, Javascript, and PHP to have the students input their selections</li>
                            <li>MySQL is used for a databaseto keep track of students and schools</li>

              <span id="VRPBDetails">
              <p>This was a group project without our Operating Systems class. The main idea of this projet was to understand the concpets of routing and implementing different heuristics to get the best possible                        solution.  A Vehicle Routing Problem(VRP) is a NP Complete problem, meaning that there is no "Best" solution.  A Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB) includes pickups in the pickup delivery scenario.
                While working on the project, we came up with two different ways to "solve" this problem.  The first was where the pickup contents can be reused for dropoffs.  The second way was the absolute opposite,
                  pickup contents are not used for dropoffs, but the truck has to go back to the depot when full.
